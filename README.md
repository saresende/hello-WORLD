Hello, my name is Samuel Resende! I'm a recent graduate from the University of Central Florida. I studied Psychology with a minor in Digital Media. I graduated from the Burnett Honors college, and with Honors in the Major for completing an undergraduate thesis. I learned Adobe Flash in high school and college level courses, but I am overall new to coding! After experimenting with Code Academy and Khan Academy, I am hooked! Looking forward to every day that I learn more about these interesting softwares. Until next time!
